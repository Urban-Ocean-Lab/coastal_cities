# United States Coastal Cities Analysis

This analysis is intended to determine the number of Americans living in coastal cities. While our definition of coastal
is static - any area that falls within a census-designated coastal county - because the definition of what constitutes a
city is so fluid, we employ three different definitions: an incoporated place within an Urbanized Area, an incorporated 
place within an Urbanized Cluster, or a Metropolitan Area. Our published piece **INSERT TITLE HERE** adheres to the 
definition of a city as an Urbaizedn Area.

Definitions:

- Coastal County
- Incorporated Place
- Urbanized Area
- Urban Cluster
- Metropolitan Statistical Area
- Micropolitan Statistical Area

Methodology:

The U.S. Census Bureau provides population statistics for all incorporated places with a total population greater than 50 thousand. These incorporated places are legally bound entities, such as cities and towns, with their own government and relatively static borders. The next step was to introduce a density requirement.
While cities and urbanization often go hand in hand, they are not the same thing. Cities can be urban, rural, or somewhere in between. The Census provides two classifications for the level of urbanization: Urbanized Clusters, places with a density of 2.5 to 50 thousand people per Census block, and Urbanized Areas, places with a density of more than 50 thousand people per Census block – all other areas are classified as Rural. For the purpose of this analysis, we defined a city as any incorporated place that fell within an Urban Area. In order to determine how many of these cities are coastal, we went through each city, one-by-one, to determine if it fell in a Census-designated coastal county.
Of the 767 incorporated places that fit our definition of a city, 262 are coastal. These 262 coastal cities sport a population of over 49 million, about 15 percent of the current U.S. population. That’s nearly eight times the estimate provided by the Columbia University data.
So that’s a substantially higher number of people that will be affected by rising seas and associated floods and storm surges. But, in the context of risk, understanding how certain communities will be disproportionately impacted by risk is just as important as determining how many. About 63 percent of the people who live in coastal cities are people of color – that’s about 31 million people. In addition, nearly eight million people, about 16 percent of the population of coastal cities are living at or below the poverty line. These metrics are important because, in coastal cities, communities of color and low-income communities often bear the brunt of the risk.
