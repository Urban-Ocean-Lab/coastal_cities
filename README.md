# United States Coastal Cities Analysis

This analysis is intended to determine the number of Americans living in coastal cities. While our definition of coastal
is static - any area that falls within a census-designated coastal county - because the definition of what constitutes a
city is so fluid, we employ three different definitions: an incoporated place within an Urbanized Area, an incorporated 
place within an Urbanized Cluster, or a Metropolitan Area. Our published piece **INSERT TITLE HERE** adheres to the 
definition of a city as an Urbaizedn Area.

Definitions:

- Coastal County
- Incorporated Place
- Urbanized Area
- Urban Cluster
- Metropolitan Statistical Area
- Micropolitan Statistical Area
